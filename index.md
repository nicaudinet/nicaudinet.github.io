Hi!

I am a French/Italian computer scientist. I grew up in Rome, Italy, and have
since lived in Wales, England, Finland and Sweden.

Currently I am a PhD student at [Chalmers University of
Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/) where I am part of the
[NLP@DSAI](https://dsai-nlp.github.io/) group. My
[research](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~richajo/projects/wasphs2023.html)
involves developing and applying methods that make use of text data for more
accurate and robust estimates of causal effects in the social sciences. My
research lies at the intersection of causality and natural language processing.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at [Relex
Solutions](https://www.relexsolutions.com/) where I helped develop an internal
deployment tool. I primarily worked with Haskell, Elm, Nix and Linux. Functional
programming is my favourite programming paradigm.

I did my bachelor and masters at the [University of
Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) in Computer Science and Electronics. I also
completed a second masters at Chalmers in [Complex Adaptive
Systems](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/find-masters-programme/complex-adaptive-systems-msc/).

I attended [UWC Atlantic College](https://www.uwcatlantic.org/) from 2012 to
2014.

Topics I am interested in:
- Causality and causal inference
- Machine learning
- Complex systems
- Functional programming

I also love to read, code, sing, dance and lift weights.
