# Nicolas Audinet de Pieuchon

Hi!

I am a French/Italian computer scientist. I grew up in Rome, Italy, and have
since lived in Wales, England, Finland and Sweden.

Currently I am a PhD student at [Chalmers University of
Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/) where I am part of the
[NLP@DSAI](https://dsai-nlp.github.io/) group. My
[research](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~richajo/projects/wasphs2023.html)
involves developing and applying methods that make use of text data for more
accurate and robust estimates of causal effects in the social sciences. My
research lies at the intersection of causality and natural language processing.

Previously, I worked as a software engineer at [Relex
Solutions](https://www.relexsolutions.com/) where I helped develop an internal
tool to manage the installation and customization. I primarily worked with
Haskell, Nix and Linux. Functional programming is my favorite programming
paradigm.

I did my bachelor and master and masters at the [University of
Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) in Computer Science and Electronics. I also
completed a second masters at Chalmers in [Complex Adaptive
Systems](https://www.chalmers.se/en/education/find-masters-programme/complex-adaptive-systems-msc/).

I attended [UWC Atlantic College](https://www.uwcatlantic.org/) from 2012 to
2014.

Some topics I am generally interested in:
- Causality and causal inference
- Machine learning
- Complex systems
- Functional programming

I also love to read, code, sing, dance and lift weights!
