        <p>Hi!</p>

        <p>
            My name is Nicolas Audinet de Pieuchon. I recently started as a PhD student at
            <a href="https://www.chalmers.se/personer/audinet/">Chalmers University
                of Technology</a>
            where I do
            <a href="https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~richajo/projects/wasphs2023.html">research</a>
            in causal inference and Natural Language Processing.
        </p>

            Before starting my PhD, I worked as a Haskell engineer at
            <a href="https://www.relexsolutions.com/">Relex Solutions.</a>
